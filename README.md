# WORK IN PROGRESS, ONLY INSTALL FOR TESTING
This is an Archipelago Mod for Library of Ruina. Currently work in progress, you can download the beta of the mod and the .apworld to test it, but DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT EVER EVER add it to actual big AP runs yet, since it is not finished, and can break in most unpredicted ways
